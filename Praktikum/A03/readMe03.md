# gdv-Aufgabe03

This program creates a hybrid image from two images. Here, two different images are superimposed, creating an optical illusion with low and high frequencies.

We used the library of numpy version 1.21.2 and opencv version 4.5.3.56 to help with this task. 
The Python version that was used is 3.9.7

To be able to use this program, the folder in which the .py file is stored must contain an image folder with two images that are named 
"image1" and "image2
