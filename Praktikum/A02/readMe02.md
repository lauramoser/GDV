# gdv-Aufgabe02

This program detects how many smarties of the same color are in an image.
The same colored Smarties are marked with a green rectangle.
In the end the program checks if all smarties of the corresponding color were found and outputs it in the console.

We used the library of numpy verion 1.21.2 an opencv version 4.5.3.56 to help with this task. 
The Python version that was used is v2021.11.1422169775.

To be able to use this program, the folder in which the .py file is stored must contain an image folder with an image that is named 
"chewing_gum-balls"
